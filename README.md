# JoseCebrian-Portfolio
Repository of Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence projects, from exploratory analysis to implementation of Deep Learning algorithms.
# [Project 1: Predicting Bread Price Increases using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/JoseCebrian12/Bread_price_prediction) 
For this example project, a bread price classifier was built to predict whether the average bread price would increase or not in the near future. This model could be used to help consumers and businesses plan and make commercial decisions, as well as to forecast changes in bread prices. Historical data on bread and flour prices was used to develop the model, and logistic regression was employed to predict whether the price of bread would increase in the next month. The model's accuracy was evaluated using data from the previous 100 months, and its suitability for implementation in a future product or service was analyzed.

# [Project 2: Predictive Modeling for In-Hospital Mortality among ICU-Admitted Heart Failure Patients](https://github.com/JoseCebrian12/Bread_price_prediction) 
This project aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality among ICU-admitted HF patients using the MIMIC III dataset. The project included an exploratory data analysis, pre-processing steps such as scaling the data and addressing class imbalance with SMOTE, and training an XGBoost model to predict the outcome variable. The final model achieved promising results and could potentially be used to inform clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.
