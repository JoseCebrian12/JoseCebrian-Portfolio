Hi! I'm Jose Cebrian, a senior Biomedical Engineering student with a strong interest in medical imaging, as well as data science. In my portfolio, you'll find some of the projects I've worked on in the field of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. From data exploration to the implementation of deep learning algorithms, each project has been designed to solve a real-world problem using advanced tools and techniques in these areas. I have experience working as a research assistant for projects related to medical imaging and thermal modeling, and as a teaching assistant for advanced programming courses. I've also completed courses and certifications in deep learning and competitive programming, and possess technical skills in Python, R, MATLAB, and PostgreSQL. I'm a proactive, self-taught, and responsible individual who enjoys working on projects and collaborating with teams to achieve the best possible outcomes.

# [Project 1: Manchester City Treble Winners Analysis](https://github.com/JoseCebrian12/ManCity2022-2023) 
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In this project, I analyzed Manchester City's performance during their historic treble-winning season (Premier League, FA Cup, and Champions League). This analysis covers both team and individual player performance, with a focus on offensive and defensive metrics. Using data from various competitions, I explored key statistics like goals (GF), expected goals (xG), and defensive actions, providing deep insights into how the team and key players like Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne performed. Visualizations were created using Matplotlib, mplsoccer, and integrated player images for an enhanced presentation.

# [Project 2: Predictive Modeling for In-Hospital Mortality among ICU-Admitted Heart Failure Patients](https://github.com/JoseCebrian12/icu-admission) 
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
This project aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality among ICU-admitted HF patients using the MIMIC III dataset. The project included an exploratory data analysis, pre-processing steps such as scaling the data and addressing class imbalance with SMOTE, and training an XGBoost model to predict the outcome variable. The final model achieved promising results and could potentially be used to inform clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

# [Project 3: Development and evaluation of an artificial intelligence model for the automation of early diagnosis of liver fluke using automated reading of biomarker tests](https://github.com/JoseCebrian12/Tesis-fasciola)
<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
This project aims to develop an alternative method for the detection of Fasciola hepatica using colorimetry, employing machine learning and computer vision techniques. To achieve this, several tasks will be carried out, including determining the technical requirements and necessary variables for the development of the predictive model of color ranges, designing and implementing an image processing system that allows the removal of background and improves accuracy in the detection of biomarkers, developing the predictive model for the classification of images obtained from biomarkers as positive or negative for the presence of Fasciola hepatica, validating the performance of the predictive model using precision parameters compared to current detection techniques on real patient samples, and finally, creating an interface that allows interaction with the hardware responsible for acquiring images from samples.
